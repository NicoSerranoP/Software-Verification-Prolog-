While Loop Verification Software:

In order to proof that the while is working logically
correct (as P{Q}R) I have divided the while verification
in two main steps:

  1. condition
  2. body

So in order to know that the loop is logically correct
we need to verify:

  1. P is true
  2. Q is execution within rules of the language
  3. R is going to be true with cond false

To check your while loop, you need to follow these steps:

  1. enter the initialized variables of the loop
      initelement(variable).
      // example: initelement(n).

  2. enter the while condition set like
      whilecond(loop_name,variable1,sign,variable2).
      // example: whilecond(while_1,n,<,p).

  3. enter the type of the two variables like
      type(loop_name,variable1,variable2).
      // example: type(while_1,int,int).

  5. indicate which element is modified in the loop
      insielement(loop_name,variable).
      // example: insielement(while_1,cont).

  6. specify if there is another line in the code like
      lines(loop_name).
      // example: lines(while_1).

  6. indicate modifier action of variable like
      increase(loop_name,variable).
      // example: increase(while_1,cont).
